# Ride the Whale! Docker for Drupalists

## Summary

Dev Desktop, WAMP, and MAMP are trusty tools in your Drupal toolkit. The more projects you take on, the more of a headache they become: conflicting versions of PHP, modules, configuration, and where in the heck did I put that INI file!? You're here to get work done, not headdesk because you've got the wrong version of Drush!

What if you could build a custom server environment for each project, using only a few text files? What if you could share those files in your repo so everyone on your team uses the exact same environment? You can!

Docker is an alternative to local environments like Dev Desktop and heavy, resource intensive VMs, with build automation built in. In this session we'll get inside Docker, and create a custom server environment step by step for your Drupal project!
